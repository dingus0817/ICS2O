##pseudocode:
##- establish constants/variables
##- import a random integer from 1 - 3 
##- assign each integer either rock paper or scissors
##- get input from user (1 for rock, 2 for paper, 3 for scissors)
##- translate input into rock paper or scissors
##- counted loop for 5 rounds, only end loop if player gets 3 points (by winning) or 5 rounds passed
##- set a counter to keep track of the points the player earns
##- print results
